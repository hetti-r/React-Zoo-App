# React Zoo App

This is a simple app for displaying categories of animals and having options to like, dislike and delete them. Every animal has an additional single page with a bigger image and a little snippet of information coming from the Wikipedia. All the animal pictures come from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) and are randomized when the page is refreshed. The header image changes by the category and uses a random image with unique search words such as "forest" and "sky". The project was done as an exercise for a React course. It uses React and Vite as it's base and an Javascript object and [Wikpedia REST API](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/) as the data. The React course and the code base was given by Margit Tennosaar at Business College Helsinki.
